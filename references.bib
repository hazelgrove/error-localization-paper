abstract = {We present the design and implementation of a compiler from OCaml bytecode to JavaScript. The compiler first translates the bytecode into a static single-assignment intermediate representation on which optimizations are performed, before generating JavaScript. We believe that taking bytecode as an input instead of a high-level language is a sensible choice. Virtual machines provide a very stable API. Such a compiler is thus easy to maintain. It is also convenient to use, and it can just be added to an existing installation of the development tools. Already-compiled libraries can be used directly, with no need to reinstall anything. Finally, some virtual machines are the target of several languages. A bytecode to JavaScript compiler would make it possible to retarget all these languages to Web browsers at once.

We present an approach where the location associated with an error message e is defined as a slice Pe of the program P being type-checked. We show that this approach yields highly accurate positional information: Pe is a program that contains precisely those program constructs in P that caused error e. Semantically, we have the interesting property that type-checking Pe is guaranteed to produce the same error e. Our approach is completely language-independent and has been implemented for a significant subset of Pascal. We also report on experiments with object-oriented type systems, and with a subset of ML.},

  abstract = {Many languages are beginning to integrate dynamic and static typing. Siek and Taha
              offered gradual typing as an approach to this integration that provides a coherent and
              full-span migration between the two disciplines. However, the literature lacks a
              general methodology for designing gradually typed languages. Our first contribution is
              to provide a methodology for deriving the gradual type system and the compilation to
              the cast calculus. Based on this methodology, we present the Gradualizer, an algorithm
              that generates a gradual type system from a well-formed type system and also generates
              a compiler to the cast calculus. Our algorithm handles a large class of type systems
              and generates systems that are correct with respect to the formal criteria of gradual
              typing. We also report on an implementation of the Gradualizer that takes a type system
              expressed in lambda-prolog and outputs its gradually typed version and a compiler to
              the cast calculus in lambda-prolog.},

  abstract = {Gradual typing lets programmers evolve their dynamically typed programs by gradually
              adding explicit type annotations, which confer benefits like improved performance and
              fewer run-time failures.However, we argue that such evolution often requires a giant
              leap, and that type inference can offer a crucial missing step. If omitted type
              annotations are interpreted as unknown types, rather than the dynamic type, then static
              types can often be inferred, thereby removing unnecessary assumptions of the dynamic
              type. The remaining assumptions of the dynamic type may then be removed by either
              reasoning outside the static type system, or restructuring the code.We present a type
              inference algorithm that can improve the performance of existing gradually typed
              programs without introducing any new run-time failures. To account for dynamic typing,
              types that flow in to an unknown type are treated in a fundamentally different manner
              than types that flow out. Furthermore, in the interests of backward-compatibility, an
              escape analysis is conducted to decide which types are safe to infer. We have
              implemented our algorithm for ActionScript, and evaluated it on the SunSpider and V8
              benchmark suites. We demonstrate that our algorithm can improve the performance of
              unannotated programs as well as recover most of the type annotations in annotated
              programs.},

  abstract = {Gradual typing is a discipline for integrating dynamic checking into a static type
              system. Since its introduction in functional languages, it has been adapted to a
              variety of type systems, including object-oriented, security, and substructural. This
              work studies its application to implicitly typed languages based on type inference.
              Siek and Vachharajani designed a gradual type inference system and algorithm that
              infers gradual types but still rejects ill-typed static programs. However, the type
              system requires local reasoning about type substitutions, an imperative inference
              algorithm, and a subtle correctness statement.This paper introduces a new approach to
              gradual type inference, driven by the principle that gradual inference should only
              produce static types. We present a static implicitly typed language, its gradual
              counterpart, and a type inference procedure. The gradual system types the same programs
              as Siek and Vachharajani, but has a modular structure amenable to extension. The
              language admits let-polymorphism, and its dynamics are defined by translation to the
              Polymorphic Blame Calculus.The principal types produced by our initial type system mask
              the distinction between static parametric polymorphism and polymorphism that can be
              attributed to gradual typing. To expose this difference, we distinguish static type
              parameters from gradual type parameters and reinterpret gradual type consistency
              accordingly. The resulting extension enables programs to be interpreted using either
              the polymorphic or monomorphic Blame Calculi.},

In addition to the inherent advantages of full LR(1) parsing, it contains a number of novel features. This paper discusses three of them in detail: an LR(1) grammar specified automatic error recovery algorithm, oracles, and generic tokens.The error recovery algorithm depends on the fact that full LR(1) parse tables preserve context. Oracles are pieces of code that are defined in a grammar and that are executed between the scanner and parser. They are used to resolve token ambiguities, including semantic ones. Generic tokens are used to replace syntactically identical tokens with a single token, which is, in effect, a variable representing a set of tokens.},

abstract = {Advanced type systems often need some form of type inference to reduce the burden of explicit typing, but type inference often leads to poor error messages for ill-typed programs. This work pursues a new approach to constructing compilers and presenting type-error messages in which the type-checker itself does not produce the messages. Instead, it is an oracle for a search procedure that finds similar programs that do type-check. Our two-fold goal is to improve error messages while simplifying compiler construction. Our primary implementation and evaluation is for Caml, a language with full type inference. We also present a prototype for C++ template functions, where type instantiation is implicit. A key extension is making our approach robust even when the program has multiple independent type errors.},

  abstract = {Modern integrated development environments (IDEs) offer
  recommendations to aid development, such as auto-completions, refactorings,
  and fixes for compilation errors. Recommendations for each code location are
  typically computed independently of the other locations. We propose that an
  IDE should consider the whole codebase, not just the local context, before
  offering recommendations for a particular location. We demonstrate the
  potential benefits of our technique by presenting four concrete scenarios in
  which the Eclipse IDE fails to provide proper Quick Fixes at relevant
  locations, even though it offers those fixes at other locations. We describe
  a technique that can augment an existing IDE's recommendations to account
  for non-local information. For example, when some compilation errors depend
  on others, our technique helps the developer decide which errors to resolve
  first.},

However, because these environments represent code as plain text, it is difficult and sometimes impossible to embed interactive tools, annotations, and alternative views in the code itself. Barista is an implementation framework that enables the creation of such user interfaces by simplifying the implementation of editors that represent code internally as an abstract syntax tree and maintain a corresponding, fully structured visual representation on-screen. Barista also provides designers of editors with a standard text-editing interaction technique that closely mimics that of conventional text editors, overcoming a central usability issue of previous structured code editors.},

  abstract = {Programmers frequently use instructive code examples found on the Web to overcome cognitive barriers while programming. These examples couple the concrete functionality of code with rich contextual information about how the code works. However, using these examples necessitates understanding, configuring, and integrating the code, all of which typically take place after the example enters the user's code and has been removed from its original instructive context. In short, a user's interaction with an example continues well after the code is pasted. This paper investigates whether treating examples as "first-class" objects in the code editor - rather than simply as strings of text - will allow programmers to use examples more effectively. We explore this through the creation and evaluation of Codelets. A Codelet is presented inline with the user's code, and consists of a block of example code and an interactive helper widget that assists the user in understanding and integrating the example. The Codelet persists throughout the example's lifecycle, remaining accessible even after configuration and integration is done. A comparative laboratory study with 20 participants found that programmers were able to complete tasks involving examples an average of 43\% faster when using Codelets than when using a standard Web browser.},

The editor is oriented to the calculational mathematics involved in algorithmic problem solving and it provides features that allow reliable structure manipulation of mathematical formulae, as well as flexible and interactive presentations. We describe some of its most important features, including the use of gestures to manipulate algebraic formulae, the structured selection of expressions, definition and redefinition of operators in runtime, gesture's editor, and handwritten templates. The editor is made available in the form of a C\# class library which can be easily used to extend existing tools. For example, we have extended Classroom Presenter, a tool for ink-based teaching presentations and classroom interaction. We have tested and evaluated the editor with target users. The results obtained seem to indicate that the software is usable, suitable for its purpose and a valuable contribution to teaching and learning algorithmic problem solving.},

Higher-level domain-specific abstractions can be seamlessly integrated into C by means of modular language extension regarding syntax, type system, semantics and {IDE}. In the paper we show how language extension can address the challenges of embedded software development and report on our experience in building these extensions. We show that language workbenches deliver on the promise of significantly reducing the effort of language engineering and the construction of corresponding {IDEs}. mbeddr is built on top of the {JetBrains} {MPS} language workbench. Both {MPS} and mbeddr are open source software.},

The Cornell Program Synthesizer demands a structural perspective at all stages of program development. Its separate features are unified by a common foundation: a grammar for the programming language. Its full-screen derivation-tree editor and syntax-directed diagnostic interpreter combine to make the Synthesizer a powerful and responsive interactive programming tool.},

  abstract = {The world is experiencing a technology shift. In 2011, more touchscreen-based mobile devices like smartphones and tablets will be sold than desktops, laptops, and netbooks combined. In fact, in many cases incredibly powerful and easy-to-use smart phones are going to be the first and, in less developed countries, possibly the only computing devices which virtually all people will own, and carry with them at all times. Furthermore, mobile devices do not only have touchscreens, but they are also equipped with a multitude of sensors, such as location information and acceleration, and they are always connected to the cloud. {TouchDevelop} is a novel application creation environment for anyone to script their smartphones anywhere -- you do not need a separate {PC}. {TouchDevelop} allows you to develop mobile device applications that can access your data, your media, your sensors and allows using cloud services including storage, computing, and social networks. {TouchDevelop} targets students, and hobbyists, not necessarily the professional developer. Typical {TouchDevelop} applications are written for fun, or for personalizing the phone. {TouchDevelop}'s typed, structured programming language is built around the idea of only using a touchscreen as the input device to author code. It has built-in primitives which make it easy to access the rich sensor data available on a mobile device. In our vision, the state of the program is automatically distributed between mobile clients and the cloud, with automatic synchronization of data and execution between clients and cloud, liberating the programmer from worrying (or even having to know about) the details. We report on our experience with our first prototype implementation for the Windows Phone 7 platform, which already realizes a large portion of our vision. It is available on the Windows Phone Marketplace.},
